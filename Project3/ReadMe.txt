In this project :
1. On the Car, Land, House page, I pulled the car and house information from the cars.json and houses.json files, which I kept in the json_files folder. I got the data with the javascript code I wrote between the script tags I used in the detail_page.html file.
2. On the home page(index.html), I pulled the information from the api. I got the data from this address "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" with the get method.
Plugins and widgets used:
jQuery (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js): This is a JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and AJAX interactions.
